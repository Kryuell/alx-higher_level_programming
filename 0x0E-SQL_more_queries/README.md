0x0E. SQL - More queries
Introduction
Welcome to the "0x0E. SQL - More queries" project of the ALX Software Engineering program! This project delves deeper into SQL databases and queries, building upon the foundational knowledge gained in previous projects. In this project, you will have the opportunity to further explore complex SQL queries, database manipulation, and data retrieval techniques.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to reinforce and expand your understanding of SQL databases, allowing you to tackle more advanced database-related tasks and challenges. By completing the tasks and exercises in this project, you will gain valuable hands-on experience with:

Advanced SQL query syntax and functions
Subqueries and nested queries
Joins and relationships between database tables
Data manipulation and analysis techniques
Database optimization and performance tuning
Project Structure
The "0x0E. SQL - More queries" project consists of a series of tasks and exercises designed to progressively challenge and enhance your SQL skills. Each task presents a specific database-related problem or scenario to solve using SQL queries. You will be required to write SQL queries to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data from the provided databases.

The project includes a combination of mandatory and advanced tasks, with optional bonus tasks for those seeking an extra challenge. You are encouraged to complete all tasks to solidify your understanding and mastery of SQL concepts.

Requirements
To complete this project, you will need:

Access to a MySQL or PostgreSQL database server
Basic knowledge of SQL syntax, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements
Understanding of database tables, relationships, and constraints
Familiarity with common SQL functions and operators
Ability to use command-line or GUI-based database management tools (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin)
Getting Started
To get started with the "0x0E. SQL - More queries" project, follow these steps:
