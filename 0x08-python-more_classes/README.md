0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects
Welcome to the "0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects" module! This module is part of the curriculum for Software Engineering students at Alx Africa.

Description
This module focuses on advanced concepts related to classes and objects in Python. We will explore topics such as inheritance, encapsulation, class methods, static methods, instance variables vs. class variables, properties, and magic methods. By mastering these concepts, you will be able to design more complex and flexible software systems.

Installation
To use the code examples provided in this module, you need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download and install it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/). Make sure to choose the version that is compatible with your operating system.

Usage
Each topic in this module is covered in separate lessons. It is recommended to go through the lessons in order, as they build upon each other. Each lesson includes explanations of the concepts and provides code examples to illustrate their usage.

To run the code examples, you can use any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Python. Simply copy the code and run it using the Python interpreter. You can also experiment with the code by modifying it and observing the results.

Examples
Here are a few examples of the topics covered in this module:
# Example of inheritance
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

# Example of encapsulation
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):
        self.__account_number = account_number
        self.__balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self.__balance >= amount:
            self.__balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient balance")

# Example of using properties
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.__width = width
        self.__height = height

    @property
    def area(self):
        return self.__width * self.__height

    @property
    def width(self):
        return self.__width

    @property
    def height(self):
        return self.__height

    @width.setter
    def width(self, value):
        if value > 0:
            self.__width = value

    @height.setter
    def height(self, value):
        if value > 0:
            self.__height = value
