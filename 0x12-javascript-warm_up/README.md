Description
In this project, you will find a series of JavaScript files, each corresponding to a specific task aimed at improving your understanding and proficiency in JavaScript programming. The tasks cover a range of topics including:

Data Types: Understanding and working with different data types in JavaScript such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, etc.

Data Structures: Exploring built-in data structures like arrays, objects, and maps, and understanding how to manipulate and iterate over them.

Control Flow: Implementing conditional statements (if, else-if, else) and loops (for, while) to control the flow of execution in JavaScript programs.

Error Handling: Learning how to handle errors gracefully using try-catch blocks and throw statements in JavaScript.

Each task is designed to progressively build upon the previous ones, reinforcing your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.
