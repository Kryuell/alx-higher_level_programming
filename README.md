# High level Programming Projects Repository

Welcome to the Kryuell Programming Projects Repository! This collection showcases a series of projects completed as part of the alx-Holberton curriculum on Higher Level Programming.

## Overview

In the world of software development, a higher-level language (HLL) is a programming language that empowers developers to create programs in a more user-friendly and abstracted context. These languages are designed to be independent of the underlying hardware architecture, allowing programmers to focus on the logic and functionality of their code rather than intricate hardware details.

## Projects

This repository houses a diverse range of projects that explore and apply high-level programming concepts. Each project is a testament to the proficiency and creativity developed through the alx-Holberton curriculum. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a curious learner, these projects offer a glimpse into the power and versatility of high-level programming.
